A Python implementation of the Sellers (1985) two-stream radiative transfer model for vegetation canopies. 

This version is capable of being set up to mimic the calculations in JULES and CLM as well as having generic functions to allow the use of arbitrary leaf angular distributions and "structure factors" (after Pinty et al. (2006)).

This version has been patched to work with Python3 by CliMA developers at Caltech.
